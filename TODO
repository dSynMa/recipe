- sanity check to check if nuxmv is available
- mention in dsynma webpage
- documentation (make it clear each specification is checked separately (not conjunctively))
- update github readme
- add list of unusable keywords (progress, prog, keep-all etc)
- save model and open model, save dot/png file
- resizing of boxes
- highlight constants and variables differently
- only for model checking: ignore receive transition labels not mentioned in the specifications (if specifications mention different receive labels, create different models)
- Update paper translation function
- for simulation, send transition labels as variables; and untagged transitions marked by arbitrary labels that are not shown to user, but used to highlight transitions in dot file
- trace visualisation as sequence diagrams
- use ic3 engine for infinite-state model checking
- DONE on start Next button is Start button
- DONE visualise graphs vertically rather than horizontally
- DONE return DOT file better
- DONE keep model checking results after tab change to simulate
- DOING migrate frontend to reactjs (so page does not need to be relaoded fully)
