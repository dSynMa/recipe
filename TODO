- mention in dsynma webpage
- add list of unusable keywords (progress, prog, keep-all etc)
- save model and open model, save dot/png file
- resizing of boxes
- highlight constants and variables differently
- only for model checking: ignore receive transition labels not mentioned in the specifications (if specifications mention different receive labels, create different models)
- for simulation, send transition labels as variables; and untagged transitions marked by arbitrary labels that are not shown to user, but used to highlight transitions in dot file
- trace visualisation as sequence diagrams
- deploy to server (add timeouts to model checking)
- don't care labellings, three valued semantics

- LTOL: add support for LTOL
 - <o> \phi -> next (o && \phi)
 - [o] \phi -> next (o -> \phi)
